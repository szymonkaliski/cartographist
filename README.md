# Cartographist

Cartographist is an experimental web browser optimized for rabbit-holing.

- Instead of opening new windows (with `cmd`-click), Cartographist spawns horizontally scrollable panes.
- Instead of forcing you to find things in a linear history, Cartographist shows a tree-structured outline of your browsing.
- Instead of always starting fresh, Cartographist can save, and load "trails" - the exact state of the session you've left - supporting researching topics over long periods of time.

## Running

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

No binary builds are available right now, purely out of laziness.
